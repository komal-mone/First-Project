    <p><span style="color: blue;">My name is yuki funaoga from japen. I have 6 people in my family. 8 hours ago, some people posted about their trip to Toronto to visit tourist attractions and try different foods.
It made me feel really excited because I also want to visit places like that. I saw pictures on social media of places in Toronto, Alberta, Montreal, and Quebec. The streets looked clean,
 the buildings were shining in the sunlight, and people seemed happy and relaxed.

8 hours passed, and I still thought about it. My dad said if we have time, we can go traveling later this year. He began to write a travel plan for us.</span>

<span style="color: yellowgreen;">Now I have grown up. Our family lives separately â€” my parents and grandmother are living in Japan, where I was born. I have two older brothers who are taking college courses, and I'm living in
 the U.S.A. also for studies.
But of course, we will travel this year too. We'll probably go to Germany this summer vacation, which is the place my mom wants to visit.

As for me, wherever I am traveling with my family, it is always much fun and meaningful, since we have less time together now.</span></p>
