    <h2>Patrick Young</h2>
    <p>A paragraph is a distinct section of written work, typically consisting of several sentences, that focuses on a single idea or topic. It's usually marked by an indent at the beginning of the first sentence. Paragraphs help organize writing, 
        making it easier for readers to follow the author's thoughts and understand the flow of ideas. <br><br>
        Here's a more detailed breakdown: <br>
Focus: <br>
Each paragraph should develop a single main point or idea. <br>
Structure: <br>
Paragraphs often follow a structure of a topic sentence (introducing the main idea), body sentences (providing details and examples), and a concluding sentence (summarizing the point or transitioning to the next paragraph). <br>
Unity and Coherence: <br>
Sentences within a paragraph should be related to the central idea and flow logically together. <br>
Indentation: <br>
Paragraphs are visually separated from each other by an indentation, which signals a new idea is being introduced. <br>
Length: <br>
While there are no rigid rules, paragraphs are generally longer than a single sentence and often consist of several sentences. However, some writing styles, like journalism, may use very short paragraphs. <br><br>
